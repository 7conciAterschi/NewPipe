## What are the features and benefits of Lectra Modaris V6R1?
 
Lectra Modaris V6R1 offers many features and benefits for apparel professionals, such as:
 
- **Increased productivity:** Lectra Modaris V6R1 allows users to create and modify patterns faster and easier with its powerful construction tools. Users can draw curves, lines, points, darts, notches, seams, pleats, folds, hems, corners, mitered corners, buttons, buttonholes, zippers, pockets, collars, cuffs, and more with precision and accuracy. Users can also use existing patterns or templates as a base for new models or collections. Users can save time by using automatic grading tools that adjust patterns according to different sizes and measurements. Users can also reduce the number of physical prototypes needed for validation by using 3D simulation tools that show how garments look and fit on virtual models or mannequins.
- **Improved quality:** Lectra Modaris V6R1 allows users to verify the quality and fit of garments before production with its verification tools. Users can check the balance, symmetry, alignment, seam allowance, ease allowance, grainline direction, fabric shrinkage, fabric stretchability, fabric weight, fabric drapeability, fabric printability, fabric colorfastness, fabric durability, fabric compatibility, fabric cost-effectiveness
and more with accuracy and consistency. Users can also use 3D simulation tools to check the appearance and behavior of fabrics and trims on garments under different lighting conditions and movements.
- **Enhanced innovation:** Lectra Modaris V6R1 allows users to explore new design possibilities and create unique and original garments with its creative tools. Users can use 3D draping tools to create realistic folds and drapes on fabrics. Users can also use 3D simulation tools to experiment with different fabrics
and trims on garments. Users can also use 3D animation tools to create dynamic presentations of garments on virtual models or mannequins.
- **Facilitated collaboration:** Lectra Modaris V6R1 allows users to exchange pattern information with other stakeholders in a simple and clear way with its communication tools. Users can export patterns in various formats such as DXF
(AAMA/ASTM), HPGL (ISO), PDF (Adobe), PLT (Lectra), PDS (Lectra), MDL (Lectra), etc. Users can also import patterns from other sources such as CAD systems
or scanners. Users can also use 3D simulation tools to share realistic images or videos of garments with clients or suppliers via email or web.
